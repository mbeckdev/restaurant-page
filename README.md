# restaurant-page

A restaurant page created with webpack

Why I made this:
To practice using webpack.  It makes some sense now! 

What I learned:
Webpack minifies my code and allows for a lot of other things. 
I split the tabs of the site into separate JavaScript files and used functions from each in other JavaScript files using export and import.
I used npm to install a few things like webpack, webpack for the command line, css-loader so I can use css with webpack
I created a package.json that keeps track of the things you install
I created a webpack.config.js file that specifies which file will be minified and what output file it'll create and where.  (here src is for development, and dist is for the final product)


Things to do:
-Make it more responsive for mobile sizes. The rule of thumb is 'start with mobile first' I did not do that and I feel like I need to at least allow for a good looking mobile version. I mean I heard that something like 50% of web users are on their phones.
